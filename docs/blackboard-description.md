# Blackboard Description

The project will be done in teams of 6 students. The goal is to apply deep learning methods on a research-oriented problem. The project description will be available on 6th December 2023. For technical/programming questions, you can go to the Computer Lab and talk with your TA (Optional).

## Final deliverable

You will submit a 4-6 pages double column paper using the Latex or Word template here: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html  The final report will include the following:

1. Title, Authors, Abstract
2. Introduction: Introduction to the problem and motivation
3. Related work: Relevant literature
4. Approach: Methodology, technical details and choices made
5. Results: Qualitative and quantitative analysis
6. Conclusion: Summary of your findings
7. References

## Submissions

The final report (pdf file) need to be submitted to blackboard by January 19th 23:59 hrs. (A github link to the code should be sent as supplementary material but it will not be graded). The grading will be based on the clarity of the document, the technical content, critical analysis and the performance. 
Further details
For neural network implementation, you may use any suitable library. We suggest PyTorch or Tensorflow (note that TF v2 incorporates the keras api).The documentation on the official pages of these frameworks includes several tutorials. Some other useful links, which include pointers to model checkpoints and datasets.
